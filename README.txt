Grade 11 CS Project

This game was made as part of a grade 11 CS summative project. The objective
of the game is to reach the key by moving your character and manipulating
various elements of the maze such as destructible and movable walls. Textures
were created using a 2D array of numbers--each number representing a different
color--and 2 x & y loops that would read each element of the array and output the 
textures. Map creation and collision detection also used this method of using
2D arrays and loops.
